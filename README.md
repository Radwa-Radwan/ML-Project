This project was submiited in fullfilment of the Machine Learning Course as part of the Data Science for Public Policy Masters program at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. 

### Project Description

The majority of fake news classification research is focused on fake news, primarily in the English language. In addition to using English language dataset as an initial phase of the project for testing supervised machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and Passive Aggressive Classifier performance, the project also used Spanish language fake news data set that was augmented by data web scrapped from Spanish news websites.
